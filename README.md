# Faculty Dashboard

The dashboard loads `faculty.json` each time it starts. Run it through a web server; this is also how it should be hosted on GitHub Pages:

```bash
cd /Users/dallindunn/Documents/InfoDisplay/faculty-dashboard
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

The updater keeps this dashboard copy synchronized with the main `faculty.json` file:

```bash
cd /Users/dallindunn/Documents/InfoDisplay
node update-faculty-json.js
```

## Generate local faculty profiles

The supplied `testingFacPageOpen.css` stylesheet and the `.EmployeePage-contentWrapper` from each website can be saved locally with:

```bash
node generate-faculty-websites.js
```

This creates `Fac_Website/`, one HTML file per faculty member, a copied `faculty-profile.css`, and `profile-manifest.js`. The dashboard iframe uses the local profile files when they are available.

Generated profile pages convert the source page's links into plain displayed text, so nothing inside the iframe navigates away from the self-contained local profile. If a local profile is unavailable, the iframe stays blank rather than loading the remote website.

The dashboard is configured as a touch-first kiosk interface: the dashboard and faculty profiles use swipe scrolling with hidden scrollbars, controls have larger touch targets, and the webpage cursor is hidden. Firefox's browser chrome and operating-system pointer cannot be hidden by webpage CSS; use F11 for browser fullscreen.

To use a different copy of the profile stylesheet:

```bash
FACULTY_PROFILE_CSS=/path/to/testingFacPageOpen.css node generate-faculty-websites.js
```
